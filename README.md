# LWC Page for retrieving Images from Static Resources

WIP - These components retrieve the images from static resources and send an event when the user selects a different category.
The @wire decorator has a reactive variable that calls the apex class for a new set of images matching the category.
Adding Platform Events to keep track of visits and most searched categories.
